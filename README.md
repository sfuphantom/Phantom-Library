# Phantom-Library
Team Phantom Library Package containing schematic and PCB libraries for every component.

All components use a metric grid 

It is requested that you use the components that are already within the library, if  component values aren't critical in your design the then use an existing component from the library.
If your design uses a new unique component then it will be added to this library package.

# Process for adding new components
There are two ways to add new components into the library.

1. Send the part number and description to Jarod or whoever is the current electric lead and they will add it in.
2. Create a new branch off master make the component yourself and then instantly push and do a merge request, it will be reviewed by two members for correctness before being merged into master.

# How to use the library package 

Pull the master branch, save it in a seperate folder from your project.
From within your project select add existing to project... and select the PCB library and any of the schematic libraries that are needed. It is not neccessary to include all libraries if not needed, it will only make your project larger.
